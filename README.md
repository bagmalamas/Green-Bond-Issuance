Paper title: A blockchain framework for digitizing securities issuance: the
case of green bonds

Abstract

A blockchain-enabled green bond issuance architecture that safeguards investors’ confidence in the bond’s green credentials while keeping the issuer from being accused of greenwashing. To adjust the process of bond issuance to a blockchain-enabled model, we tokenize the bonds. The digital token is created through a smart contract with a specific standard (in our case, ERC-20). Within the smart contracts developed, we use various functions to handle the prerequisites of validators and regulators’ approval based on the documentation presented and the parameters of rate and maturity requested by the issuer


The key actors of the system are:

•Issuer: Creates  and  administers  green  assets  and  shares  quantitative  impact prediction reports using clear metrics and units along with the proper documentation for the bond in question. The issuer can also integrate external audits andreviews.

•External Validator: Is responsible for validating impact prediction reports on project and framework level and also delivering a report for green commitments and green debt strategies based on the documents provided by the issuer. If the prediction impact report passes the validation procedure, the signed report gets published on the blockchain; otherwise, the report is rejected.

•Auditor: Independent third party (ITP) that can provide official and consolidated Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks.

•Investor: Creates investment portfolios, can make investment discoveries, manages assets and monitors asset impacts.

•Regulator: Oversees the consensus formation ensuring compliance and regulatory control. Regulator also has a veto right and is authorized by the participants to stop a block formation when misbehaviour is ascertained
